Commandlib is a dependencyless library for calling external UNIX commands
(e.g. in build scripts) in a clean, readable way.

Using method chaining, you can build up Command objects that run in a specific
directory, with specified [environment variables](using/alpha/environment-variables)
and [PATHs](using/alpha/add-directory-to-path), etc.

For simplicity's sake, the library itself only runs commands in a blocking
way (all commands run to completion before continuing), although it contains
hooks to run non-blocking via either [icommandlib](https://github.com/crdoconnor/icommandlib)
or [pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

{% for story in quickstart %}
{% for name, script in story.given.get('scripts', {}).items() %}
Pretend '{{ name }}':
```bash
{{ script }}
```
{%- endfor %}

```python
{{ story.given['setup'] }}
```

{% with step = story.steps[0] %}{% include "step.jinja2" %}{% endwith %}
{% endfor %}

## Install

```sh
$ pip install commandlib
```

## Docs

{% for dirfile in subdir("using/alpha/").is_not_dir() - subdir("using/alpha/").named("index.md") -%}
- [{{ title(dirfile) }}](using/alpha/{{ dirfile.namebase }})
{% endfor %}

## Why?

Commandlib avoids the tangle of messy code that you would
get using the subprocess library directly (Popen, call, check_output(), .communicate(), etc.)
and the [confusion that results](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89228/calling-an-external-command-in-python).

It's a [heavily dogfooded](https://hitchdev.com/principles/extreme-dogfooding) library. For humans. Because who else?

## Is subprocess really that bad?

The code will likely be longer and messier. For example, from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2231227/python-subprocess-popen-with-a-modified-environment):

```python
import subprocess, os
previous_directory = os.getcwd()

os.chdir("command_directory")
my_env = os.environ.copy()
my_env["PATH"] = "/usr/sbin:/sbin:" + my_env["PATH"]
subprocess.Popen(my_command, env=my_env)
os.chdir(previous_directory)
```

Equivalent:

```python
from commandlib import Command

Command(my_command).with_path("/usr/sbin:/sbin:").in_dir("command_directory").run()
```

## Why not use Delegator instead (Kenneth Reitz's 'subprocesses for humans')?

Kenneth Reitz (author of requests "urllib2/3 for humans"), wrote a similarly inspired "subprocess for humans"
called [envoy](https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy). That is now deprecated and there is now a replacement called [delegator](https://github.com/kennethreitz/delegator.py), which is a very thin
wrapper around subprocess.

Features delegator has which commandlib does not:

* Delegator can chain commands, much like bash does (delegator.chain('fortune | cowsay')). Commandlib doesn't do that because while dogfooding the library I never encountered a use case where I found this to be necessary. You can, however, easily get the output of one command using .output() as a string and feed it into another using piped.from_string(string).

* Delegator runs subprocesses in both a blocking and nonblocking way (using pexpect). commandlib only does blocking by itself but if you pip install pexpect or icommandlib it can run via either one of them.

* Runs on windows

Features which both have:

* Ability to set environment variables.
* Ability to run pexpect process from command object.

Features which only commandlib has:

* Ability to set PATH easily.
* Ability call code from within the current virtualenv easily.
* Ability to pipe in strings or files and easily pipe out to strings or file (or file handles).
* Hook to easily run commands in from the current virtualenv.

## Why not use other tools?

* os.system(*) - only capable of running very simple bash commands.

* [sh](https://amoffat.github.io/sh/) - uses a lot of magic. Attempts to make python more like shell rather than making running commands more pythonic.

* [plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]) - similar to amoffat's sh, tries to make a sort of "bash inside python". Also has a weird way of building commands from dict syntax (grep["-v", "\\.py"]).
